# DGTracker

DGTracker is a personal project for a small architectural and construction firm with multiple clients/projects. This project is part of my self-learning journey to become a full-stack developer. I started this application with experience in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, and I’m learning Node.js, Express, and databases as I build it. My goal is to understand backend development by creating real features, from setting up APIs to connecting the frontend and database.
