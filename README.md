# DGTracker

DGTracker is a personal project for a small architectural and construction firm with multiple clients/projects. This project is part of my self-learning journey to become a full-stack developer. I started this application with experience in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, and Iâ€™m learning Node.js, Express, and databases as I build it. My goal is to understand backend development by creating real features, from setting up APIs to connecting the frontend and database.

Below are the features that I want to implement to this project:
  -  User Authentication
        -  Login/Logout system.
        -  Role-based access (Admin, Employee, Client).
  -  Project Management
        -  Add new project
        -  View projects
        -  Edit or delete project information
        -  Assign empoyees to specific projects
        -  Track project progress by percentage and milestones.
  -  Employee Management
        -  Add, view, update, and remove employees.
        -  Store details: name, position, contract, hourly rate.
        -  Assign employees to one or more projects.
        -  View which employees are involved in which projects.
  -  Financial Management
        -   Add and view project expenses (materials, labor, miscellaneous).
        -   Each expenses links to project.
        -   Calculate total expenses and remaining budget.
        -   Visualize data in graphs (Expenses vs Budget).
  -  Document Management
        -  Upload, store, and view project-related files (blueprints. permits, invoices, receipts).
        -  File types allowed: PDF, JPG, PNG, DOCX.
        -  View and download uploaded documents.
        -  Delete old or unnecessary files.
  -  Dashboard
        -  Overveiw of Total projects, Total employees, Total expenses, Ongoing/completed projects
        -  Graphs for financials and project status.
        -  Quick navigation to all modules.

*Note that I used GPT Mentor here to act like my project manager since I don't have any experince in real world web development.
